    <h1>Introducing nathanjon.es</h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>After a couple of kids, a book, work, more work travel than I&#39;d care to admit and many other excuses; I finally sat down to create my new blog this weekend. I&#39;ve been sitting on nathanjon.es for a little over a year and a new blog just kept getting reprioritized.</p>
<p>Writing is a very therapeutic exercise for me. The process of writing, especially about technical topics, helps me learn. With this new site, I wanted something that was easy to maintain and allowed me to focus my time on writing. For that reason, I&#39;ve moved from a custom install Wordpress site to a static blog generated using DocPad and hosted on Github Pages. </p>
<p>As the range of devices in my life has evolved, so has my workflow. I need a writing process that fits my new workflow. That workflow consists heavily of dropbox and markdown. That workflow includes starting a post on my phone with a few bullet points, expanding on those points on my iPad, and ultimately ends with editing and publishing on my laptop.</p>
<p><em>Note: yes, I know Wordpress supports markdown to some extent. I tried it.</em></p>
<p>That said, I don&#39;t want this to be a &#39;hate on Wordpress&#39; post. I like Wordpress and, as with all tools, it&#39;s the correct answer in certain scenarios. A personal blog with my workflow just wasn&#39;t a fit in my mind. I say that after having spent quite a bit of time working on a custom theme for this blog.</p>
<h3 id="thanks">Thanks</h3>
<p><a href="http://ewal.net">Erv</a> doesn&#39;t know it, but <a href="http://www.ewal.net/2013/10/08/blogging-with-docpad/">he was a huge help</a>. As with writing, I set out to make this project a learning experience. After a bunch of research, I knew I wanted to use DocPad. I knew I wanted a clean looking and mobile friendly theme. His site is the foundation of my site with a few changes and his blog posts and open source work were incredibly helpful.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got a bunch of small things to do over the next few weeks. I want to fix how paging works, get a page up to highlight the projects I&#39;m working on, and generally make parts of the site a little more me. I&#39;m also going to slowly migrate my old content. That&#39;s an exercise of determining what is worth the effort to migrate and researching what may already be out there to help with the process. Once I can knock out a few of those tasks, I&#39;ll get the source up and available to anyone interested.</p>
<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>
<p>I&#39;m not going to specify a writing cadence. When I have something interesting to write about, or a problem I want to talk through, I&#39;ll write something. That&#39;s going to largely be driven by what is going on at work, what side projects I&#39;m working on, and what&#39;s happening with the family.</p>
<p>But, I will be writing more and I am very much looking forward to that.</p>
